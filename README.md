# React Essentails ⚛️ Project 

A single-page application (SPA) for learning React fundamentals. This interactive guide covers the four essential React concepts with concise definitions, examples and visual content.

## 💡Learning Concepts

1. **Components**  
 Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component is a self-contained module (HTML + optional CSS + JS) that renders some output.
4. **JSX**  
 JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript (e.g., it may output dynamic content).
6. **Props**  
 Components accept arbitrary inputs called props. They are like function arguments.
8. **state**  
 State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else.
